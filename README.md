**Convolution:** It is the way of extracting features out of an input image using feature matrix. Convolution creates a generally smaller output image which retains the features of the original image.
**Filters/Kernels:** Kernels are matrixes which can be used to extract features out of an image. The values of cells in a the matrix defines what kind of feature the kernel is going to extract.
**Epochs:** Epochs are the number of times a complete dataset is scanned while training a model.
**1x1 Convolution:** This convolution is used to reduce the number of parameters in a CNN while retaining the features of the image.
**3x3 Convolution:** A 3x3 convolution is used to extract the edges and gradients of an image in image processing.
